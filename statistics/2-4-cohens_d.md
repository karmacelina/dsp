[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> The magnitude of the effect that birth order has on baby's weight is small, yet it is 3 times larger than the magnitude of the effect that birth order has on pregnancy length. 

>> First pregnancies yield slightly lighter babies than subsequent ones. (Pregnancies of 2nd or later children tend to yield heavier babies relative to first born babies.)

>> First pregnancies last slightly longer than other ones. 

>> The size of the effect (first baby or other) is small in both cases.
