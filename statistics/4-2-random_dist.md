[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> When randomly sampling different 1000 numbers from 0 to 1, we expect the probability of finding a number to be 1/1000, and, indeed, when we plot the prob. mass function, we see that the pmf value for all numbers from 0 to 1 is roughly 0.001 = 1/1000. 

>> In terms of the cumulative distribution function, we expect 10% of the values samples to be from 0 to 0.1, 20% to be from 0 to 0.2, 50% to be from 0 to 0.5, and so on, and this is what we observe when we plot the CDF for the list of 1000 numbers randomly sampled from 0 to 1.
